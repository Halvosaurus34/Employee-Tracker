# Employee Tracker

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")

I was tasked with creating an interface that made it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases.  This is a **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem that allows users to manipulate employee data such as add employee, view all managers and much more.
